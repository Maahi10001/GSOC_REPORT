## Project Abstract

CodeLabz is a platform where the users can engage with online tutorials and the organizations can create tutorials for the users. The platform is developed using ReactJS front-end library and the back end is developed using the Google Cloud Firestore and Google Firebase Real-Time database. This project aims to bring changes to the UI to make the website seamless and provide more functionalities to users.

## Work Summary

During GSoC'22, I began working on the CodelabZ project's backend. For the first half of my GSoC experience, I worked on Firebase.
- Designed and implemented a new firebase local emulator suite that can replace the previous firebase blaze plan and is extremely efficient and practical for codelabz users.
- I also worked on firebase emulator operations like importing and exporting data from one database to another using simple import and export operations, which is currently a major feature of firebase.
- We improved the user interface and created reusable pages (home page, 404 pages, login page, code feed page). Some animation and effects were also added to make it more user-friendly. We replaced all of the components with Material UI and added some extras.
- The majority of the components are optimised for mobile use. For our project, I created and deployed storybook components. The storybook is nicely organised here, and the user can control and experiment with the components props own.
- In addition, for each component of our project, we wrote frontend tests (in Cypress). Later, we plan to connect it to Github actions. Firestore was primarily used by codelabz for feature implementation and data storage (users, organizations).
-   Finally, some existing bugs were fixed, and the project documentation was updated, including detailed instructions for configuring the firabse emulator and rulesets for data export and import over the databse. Codelabz is finally finished with all frontend and backend integration completed and all wikis for components and pages.
